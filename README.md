# ControlGUI
## Basic usage
* clone this repo into the `src` of a `catkin_ws`, and build it with `catkin build ControlGUI`
* run `interface.py`, either with python or rosurun
`rosrun ControlGUI interface.py`
* it must be in the same directory as the font (STIX-Bold.otf) file
* the **log** file is **cleared every time you launch the interface**
* for now, the interface *only* writes the log file *if it is ran as a python script* such as "_python interface.py_"
