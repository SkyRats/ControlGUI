#### Here's how to use our interface:
#### THIS TUTORIAL IS TOTALLY WRONG
- it must be in the same directory as the font (STIX-Bold.otf) file
- there must be a folder with the .png's named "media"
- run it with rosrun dronecontrol interface.py OR python interface.py at the interface directory
- you might run it from anywhere in the terminal, as long as the interface directory is located as ~/catkin_ws/src/dronecontrol/
- if it's not located at ~/catkin_ws/src/dronecontrol/, either move it or change the files locations at their definition
* the log file is cleared every time you launch the interface
* for now, the interface *only* writes the log file *if it is ran as a python script* such as "_python interface.py_"
